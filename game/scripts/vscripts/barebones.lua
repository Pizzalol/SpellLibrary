  This function should be used to set up Async precache calls at the beginning of the game.  The Precache() function 
  in addon_game_mode.lua used to and may still sometimes have issues with client's appropriately precaching stuff.

  be used to precache dynamically-added datadriven abilities instead of items.  PrecacheUnitByNameAsync will 
  precache the precache{} block statement of the unit and all precache{} block statements for every Ability# 
  defined on the unit.

  This function should only be called once.  If you want to/need to precache more items/abilities/units at a later
  time, you can call the functions individually (for example if you want to precache units in a new wave of
